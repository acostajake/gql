# DataScience's Frontend Code Test

This is an at-home exercise that we use as part of our standard interview process for frontend and full-stack developers. Its requirements are designed to provide us with enough insight to evaluate your skillset, but feel free to expand on its feature set if you have time (not required).

In this test, you will be using the public GraphQL API provided by Yelp to
build a client-side application that lists the top businesses around a specified location.

## Instructions

* Clone this repo
* Complete the exercise and submit either a zip of the solution or a link to a new repo
* You must use ReactJS but apart from that, you can use any resources, libraries, etc and style the markup however you like.

## Requirements

* Use the public GraphQL API provided by Yelp, for more information, see [here](https://www.yelp.com/developers/graphql/guides/intro).
* Provide way for the user to specify a location by zip code and distance.
* Display a list (or table) of businesses that match the search parameters.
* Allow filtering of businesses by category.
* Add a way for users to "favorite" certain businesses (state should be completely client-side)
* Show an alphabetically ordered list of favorite businesses. This should update as businesses are starred / unstarred.
* Persist the favorite list locally and regenerate the view on page refresh.
* In a README note any required setup to be able to run the app, such as modifying hosts file, etc.
